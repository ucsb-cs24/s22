**This assignment may be done solo or in pairs!**

# Introduction
In this assignment, you will 
* use a container data structure from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) to store and query data.
* analyze the time and space complexity of your algorithms.

The high-level goals of this assignment are to
* apply data structures from the C++ STL (STL) to efficiently solve a problem on a large, real-world dataset.
* analyze the complexity of your algorithms using Big-O notation
* explore the tradeoffs between time and space complexity.
* organize your project's code on your own (not just filling in a template).

*Note: The goals above are very important in industry and in interviews!*

# Getting Started

## Starter code

### GitHub repository
<https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-s22/STARTER-pa02>

### Contents
* `main.cpp`: driver code to read in movies from input files

## Files to complete
* `movies.cpp, movies.h`: these files should contain any abstractions that you need to define. 
	* We strongly discourage implementing any data structures from scratch.
* `main.cpp`: this file should read in the movies from input files and produce the expected output.
* `Makefile`: this file generates the executable `runMovies` 

## Problem statement
This assignment has 3 parts. You should **separate your algorithm for part 1 from your algorithm for part 2** because in part 3, you need to analyze the running time complexity of your solution to part 2 only.
* In part 1, your task is to print all movie names and ratings (from the CSV file) in alphabetical order of movie name.
* In part 2, you are given `m` prefixes of movie names. Your task is to find the movies whose names start with each prefix and find the highest rated movie for each prefix. 
* In part 3, you will analyze the time and space complexity of your solution for part 2.

## Command-line arguments
```
./runMovies filename prefix_1 prefix_2 prefix_3 ... prefix_m
```

* `filename` represents the input file containing movies and ratings (as described before).
* `prefix_i` is a prefix for one or more movie names. 
	* There may be up to `m` such prefixes in the command-line arguments.
	* If a prefix contains white spaces, it must be placed within quotation marks `"`. 

**Example of a prefix with whitespaces**
```
./runMovies input_1000_random.csv "the american" ab
```

# Part 1: Print all movie names and ratings
Your program should print out all the movies in **alphabetical order of movie name**. You may use **only one data structure** of your choice to store the data from the CSV file. When testing this part, do not give any prefixes as command-line arguments!

**Example with no prefixes**
```
./runMovies input_20_random.csv 
```
This should produce the output
```
ace ventura: when nature calls, 6.1
balto, 7.1
casino, 7.8
cutthroat island, 5.7
dracula: dead and loving it, 5.7
father of the bride part ii, 5.7
four rooms, 6.5
goldeneye, 6.6
grumpier old men, 6.5
heat, 7.7
jumanji, 6.9
money train, 5.4
nixon, 7.1
sabrina, 6.2
sense and sensibility, 7.2
sudden death, 5.5
the american president, 6.5
tom and huck, 5.4
toy story, 7.7
waiting to exhale, 6.1
```

## Part 2: Find movies based on prefixes
If one or more prefixes are given as command-line arguments, then for each prefix, your program should
* find the movies whose names start with that prefix.
* find the highest rated movie for that prefix.

You may use additional data structures from the C++ STL to help you solve this part of the assignment.

### Part 2a: All movies starting with a prefix
First, for each prefix, your program should print out all the movies whose names start with that prefix in **decreasing order of rating**. If multiple movies have the same rating, then print them in alphabetical order of movie name. For example, print `the american president, 6.5` before `the confessional, 6.5`. If no movie names start with that prefix, then print 
```
No movies found with prefix <prefix_value>
```

### Part 2b: Highest rated movie for a prefix
Second, for each prefix, your program should print the **highest rated** movie whose name starts with that prefix. If there is a tie for highest rated movie, then use the movie whose name comes first in alphabetical order.

### Examples
**Example with 3 prefixes and multiple movies with same rating**
```
./runMovies input_100_random.csv to th w
```
This should produce the following output:
```
toy story, 7.7
to die for, 6.7
tom and huck, 5.4

the usual suspects, 8.1
the city of lost children, 7.6
the postman, 7.6
the white balloon, 7.5
the journey of august king, 6.7
things to do in denver when you're dead, 6.7
the american president, 6.5
the confessional, 6.5
the crossing guard, 6.1
the indian in the cupboard, 5.9
the juror, 5.5
the big green, 5.2

wings of courage, 6.8
white squall, 6.3
waiting to exhale, 6.1
when night is falling, 5.9

Best movie with prefix to is: toy story with rating 7.7
Best movie with prefix th is: the usual suspects with rating 8.1
Best movie with prefix w is: wings of courage with rating 6.8
```

**Another example multiple movies with same rating**
```
./runMovies input_1000_random.csv be
```
should produce the output:
```
before sunrise, 7.7
before the rain, 7.7
beauty and the beast, 7.5
belle de jour, 7.3
beautiful girls, 6.6
beyond rangoon, 6.4
beat the devil, 6.2
before and after, 5.8
beverly hills cop iii, 5.5
bed of roses, 5.1
being human, 5.0
beyond bedlam, 4.0

Best movie with prefix be is: before sunrise with rating 7.7
```

**Example with no movies for a given prefix**
```
./runMovies input_100_random.csv t xyz
```
should produce the output
```
the usual suspects, 8.1
toy story, 7.7
the city of lost children, 7.6
the postman, 7.6
the white balloon, 7.5
twelve monkeys, 7.4
the journey of august king, 6.7
things to do in denver when you're dead, 6.7
to die for, 6.7
the american president, 6.5
the confessional, 6.5
the crossing guard, 6.1
the indian in the cupboard, 5.9
the juror, 5.5
tom and huck, 5.4
two bits, 5.4
the big green, 5.2
two if by sea, 4.5

No movies found with prefix xyz

Best movie with prefix t is: the usual suspects with rating 8.1
```

## Part 3: Analyze the time and space complexity of your algorithm from part 2
Assume that
* there are `n` movies in the dataset.
* there are `m` prefixes in the command-line arguments .
* at most `k` movies begin with each prefix.

### Part 3a: Analyze time complexity
Analyze the worst case Big-O time complexity of your algorithm from part 2 of the assignment. You may assume that 
* all `n` movies are already stored in your data structure.
* all `m` prefixes are already stored in an array.

You must provide the time complexity analysis as a **commented block** right after your `main()` function in `main.cpp`. Note that 
* your final answer will be some function of `n`, `m`, and/or `k`.
* your final answer will depend on your data structure and algorithm choices. 

You will be graded for the efficiency of your algorithms but also the clarity and correctness of your analysis. However, we are not giving you a target Big-O time complexity. A set of solutions that have similar Big-O time complexities will receive the same grade.

### Part 3b: Analyze space complexity
Analyze the worst case Big-O space complexity of your algorithm from part 2 of the assignment. You may assume that 
* all `n` movies are already stored in your data structure.
* all `m` prefixes are already stored in an array.

You must provide the space complexity analysis as a **commented block** under your time complexity analysis. Note that 
* your final answer will be some function of `n`, `m`, and/or `k`.
* your final answer will depend on your data structure and algorithm choices. 

You will be graded for the efficiency of your algorithms but also the clarity and correctness of your analysis. However, we are not giving you a target Big-O space complexity. A set of solutions that have similar Big-O space complexities will receive the same grade.

### Part 3c: Explore tradeoffs between time/space complexity
Briefly state how you designed your algorithm from part 2 of the assignment for the task at hand. More specifically, answer this question:
* Did you design your algorithm for a low time complexity, a low space complexity, or both?

Based on your answer to the question above, answer one of the following:
1. If you designed your algorithm for a low time complexity,
    * Were you able to achieve a low space complexity as well?
    * Why or why not?
2. If you designed your algorithm for a low space complexity,
    * Were you able to achieve a low time complexity as well?
    * Why or why not?
3. If you designed your algorithm for both,
    * Were you able to achieve both?
    * Why or why not?
    * Which was harder to achieve: low time complexity or low space complexity?

You must provide these answers as a **commented block** under your space complexity analysis.

You will be graded for the clarity and thoughtfulness of your analysis.

## Requirements
For this programming assignment, you will have a lot of flexibility on your implementation (which just means we won't be providing a code framework for you to fill in). However, there are a few requirements that you need to keep in mind as you think about your solution:

* You must make appropriate use of data structures from the STL
* Your code should be readable
* Your classes should define clear interfaces and hide implementation details as much as possible. 
* You must include your space and time complexity analyses in `main.cpp`, as a commented block under the `main()` function
* Your `Makefile` must produce an executable called `runMovies` from the `make` command.
